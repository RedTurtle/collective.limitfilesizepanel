Introduction
============

Plone Archetypes framework already gives you a max size validation for files and images, but the default
configuration has some drawbacks:

* is not simple to customize (best way is to use `plone.recipe.atcontenttypes`__)
* is the same for every Plone site of the environment

__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.recipe.atcontenttypes/

This product will let you customize this validation from Plone user interface.

How to use it
=============

Just add the product to the buildout and install it in the site you want to use.

A new "*Limit file size settings*" option will be added in the control panel, where you can change the
*File* and *Image* attachments.

No users will be able to upload files that exceed the limit. Also in TinyMCE text editor.

Advanced use
------------

While default general purpose file and image settings can be OK for most common scenarios,
you can also define custom settings for specific content types: just fill the
"**Settings for other content types and fields**" section.

Configuration in that section wins over global configuration.

Validator bypass
================

If some users need to bypass the validation and upload some larger files, there is a new permission
"*collective.limitfilesizepanel: Bypass limit size*" that allows to do this.

You only need to set this permission to some roles, and they'll have no upload limits.

Dependencies
============

This products has been tested on:

* Plone 3.3
* Plone 4.2
* Plone 4.3

It's based on `plone.app.registry`__ that it not part of Plone on 3.3 version. You need to be
sure that a compatible version is used (in my experience: use `version 1.0b1`__).
